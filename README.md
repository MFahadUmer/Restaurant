## Instructions for running app Locally

Restaurant App is easier to setup. 
You can use Sourcetree,
Git from the command line to clone your Git repository.
These instructions show you how to clone your repository using Git from the terminal. 
First, from the repository, click + in the global sidebar and select Clone this repository under Get to work.

Secondly, Copy the clone command (either the SSH format or the HTTPS). 
If you are using the SSH protocol, ensure your public key is in github and loaded on the local system to which you are cloning.

Third, From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository. Paste the command you copied from Github using git clone followed by link or clone command.
If the clone was successful, a new sub-directory appears on your local drive in the directory where you cloned your repository. This directory has the same name as the github repository that you cloned. 

Fourth, run [npm install] from the Terminal

Fifth, run [npm run build] from the terminal

Sixth, Open dist/index.html page with browser
